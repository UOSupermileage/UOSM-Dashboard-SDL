# SDL Simulator for UOSM Dashboard

## Usage

### Get the project

Clone the PC project and the related sub modules:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lvgl/lv_sim_vscode_sdl
```

### Install SDL
You can download SDL from https://www.libsdl.org/

On on Linux you can install it via terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev
```

### Setup
To allow custom UI code an `lv_conf.h` file placed at `ui/simulator/inc` will automatically override this projects lv_conf.h file. By default code under `ui` is ignored so you can reuse this repository for multiple projects. You will need to place a call from `main.c` to your UI's entry function.

To build and debug, press F5. You should now have your UI displayed in a new window and can access all the debug features of VSCode through GDB.

To allow temporary modification between simulator and device code, a SIMULATOR=1 define is added globally.
